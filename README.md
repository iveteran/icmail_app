## Localizations
When you change translations, re-generate the translations files by calling `flutter gen-l10n`.
Missing translations will be listed in `missing-translations.txt`.

## JSON Generation for Persistence
We use the standard [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable) package for generating 
JSON and [hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) for storage. 
When changing such classes, you have to re-run code generation
by calling `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.
